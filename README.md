## What is Syndesi

Syndesi is an open-source project that aims to facilitate communication between computers and various hardware such as lab instruments, microcontrollers, and other devices with open communication interfaces 

The project was originally created in Python. Other implementations are planned

## How is Syndesi organized ?

The Syndesi project is split in three parts :

- **Syndesi package** : The base of the syndesi project, low-level communication with devices and session management ([repo](https://github.com/syndesi-project/Syndesi))
- **Drivers** : A collection of drivers created by the community to communicate with various devices and instruments ([repo](https://github.com/syndesi-project/Drivers))
- **Devices** : Syndesi hardware to further improve communication in real word scenarios.
